# Using MCP Server Semgrep

This guide describes how to use the MCP Server Semgrep in your development workflow and highlights the transformative benefits it brings to code quality, security, and team collaboration.

## Installation

First, make sure you have Node.js (v18+) installed. The server offers multiple ways to get Semgrep:

### Option 1: Install via Smithery.ai (Recommended)

The simplest way to install and use MCP Server Semgrep is directly through Smithery.ai:

1. Visit [MCP Server Semgrep on Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai/server/@vetcoders/mcp-server-semgrep)
2. Click the "Install" button for your preferred MCP client
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation

This method handles all dependencies and configuration automatically, making it ideal for most users.

### Option 2: Install the MCP Server from NPM:

```bash
# Install from npm
npm install -g mcp-server-semgrep

# Or using pnpm
pnpm add -g mcp-server-semgrep

# Or using yarn
yarn global add mcp-server-semgrep
```

### Option 3: Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
# Install directly from GitHub repository
npm install -g git+https://github.com/vetcoders/mcp-server-semgrep.git
```

### Semgrep Installation Options:

The server includes Semgrep as an optional dependency and will automatically detect it during installation. If Semgrep is not found, you'll be guided through installation options:

```bash
# PNPM (recommended):
pnpm add -g semgrep

# NPM:
npm install -g semgrep

# macOS:
brew install semgrep

# Linux:
python3 -m pip install semgrep
# or
sudo apt-get install semgrep

# Windows:
pip install semgrep

# Others:
# See https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/
```

The server will automatically detect your Semgrep installation regardless of how it was installed, and will provide helpful guidance if it's missing.

## Workspace Roots

The server only accepts absolute paths that live inside an allowed workspace root.

- Default behavior: use `process.cwd()` as the only allowed root.
- Recommended for desktop clients and managed launchers: set `MCP_SERVER_SEMGREP_ALLOWED_ROOTS` to one or more absolute directories.
- Multiple roots use your platform delimiter: `:` on macOS/Linux, `;` on Windows.

## Running the Server

```bash
mcp-server-semgrep
```

The server will start and listen on stdio, ready to accept MCP commands.

## Tool Examples

### Scanning a Directory

In Claude Desktop, you might ask:

```
Could you scan my project directory at /path/to/code for security vulnerabilities? That directory is already covered by MCP_SERVER_SEMGREP_ALLOWED_ROOTS.
```

Behind the scenes, the MCP server handles requests like:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "scan_directory",
    "arguments": {
      "path": "/path/to/code",
      "config": "p/security"
    }
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

**Practical Application**: Run this scan before code review or deployment to catch security issues early in the development cycle.

### Listing Available Rules and Supported Languages

In Claude Desktop, you might ask:

```
What Semgrep rules are available for analyzing Python code?
```

Behind the scenes:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "list_rules",
    "arguments": {
      "language": "python"
    }
  },
  "id": 2
}
```

**Practical Application**: Discover all available rules for a specific language to better understand what types of issues you can detect and fix.

### Creating a Custom Rule

In Claude Desktop, you might say:

```
Could you create a Semgrep rule to detect uses of eval() in JavaScript files?
```

MCP request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "create_rule",
    "arguments": {
      "output_path": "/path/to/my-rule.yaml",
      "pattern": "eval(...)",
      "language": "javascript",
      "message": "Avoid using eval() as it can lead to code injection vulnerabilities",
      "severity": "ERROR",
      "id": "no-eval"
    }
  },
  "id": 3
}
```

**Practical Application**: Create custom rules for your project's specific requirements, coding standards, or to prevent recurring issues.

### Analyzing Scan Results

```
Could you analyze the Semgrep scan results I have in /path/to/results.json?
```

MCP request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "analyze_results",
    "arguments": {
      "results_file": "/path/to/results.json"
    }
  },
  "id": 4
}
```

**Practical Application**: Get a comprehensive summary of issues in your codebase to prioritize fixes and understand overall code health.

### Filtering Results

```
Show me only the high severity JavaScript issues from the scan results
```

MCP request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "filter_results",
    "arguments": {
      "results_file": "/path/to/results.json",
      "severity": "ERROR",
      "path_pattern": "\\.js$"
    }
  },
  "id": 5
}
```

**Practical Application**: Focus on the most critical issues or specific parts of your codebase to make targeted improvements.

### Exporting Results

```
Export the scan results to a SARIF file for our CI/CD pipeline
```

MCP request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "export_results",
    "arguments": {
      "results_file": "/path/to/results.json",
      "output_file": "/path/to/report.sarif",
      "format": "sarif"
    }
  },
  "id": 6
}
```

**Practical Application**: Integrate scan results with CI/CD pipelines or other tools by exporting them in standard formats like SARIF.

### Comparing Results

```
Compare the scan results from before and after our security fixes
```

MCP request:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "compare_results",
    "arguments": {
      "old_results": "/path/to/old-results.json",
      "new_results": "/path/to/new-results.json"
    }
  },
  "id": 7
}
```

**Practical Application**: Track progress over time by comparing scan results before and after refactoring or security fixes.

## Real-World Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Style Consistency Enforcement

**Problem**: Team members use inconsistent z-index values across CSS files, causing layer conflicts.

**Solution**:
1. Ask Claude to create a custom rule for detecting z-index values:
   ```
   Create a Semgrep rule to identify all z-index values in our CSS files
   ```

2. Have Claude scan the project to identify all z-index usages
   ```
   Scan our project directory for z-index values using the rule you just created
   ```

3. Ask Claude to analyze patterns and suggest a systematic approach:
   ```
   Based on these results, could you suggest a z-index layering system for our project?
   ```

### Scenario 2: Preventing "Magic Numbers"

**Problem**: Developers use hard-coded numbers throughout the code instead of named constants.

**Solution**:
1. Have Claude create a rule to detect numeric literals:
   ```
   Create a Semgrep rule to find magic numbers in our JavaScript code
   ```

2. Ask Claude to scan the codebase for these patterns:
   ```
   Use the magic numbers rule to scan our project
   ```

3. Request suggestions for improvements:
   ```
   For each of these instances, can you suggest appropriate constant names and a refactoring approach?
   ```
